# Database setup #

1. Run the command "psql -f ./db/setup.sql" in the terminal to create both Development and Test databases on your local machine
2. You can ensure that these are setup by typing in the following commands in your terminal (your terminal should display 'You are now connected to database "<db_name>" as user "<username>")
 - psql
 - \c nc_news or \c nc_news_test

# Seeding data into both databases #

1. Run the command "node ./db/seeds/run-seed.js" to create and populate all tables in the developemnt database
2. Running the testing suite with the command 'npm run test __tests__/app.test.js' will perform all tests on the test database, but will also drop all tables and repopulate them with the original data.

**Devlopment Environment**

Using Endpoints

1. Download Insomnia or your prefered web API testing platform (https://insomnia.rest/, https://www.postman.com/)
2. In the file app.listen, the function currently uses port 9090, you can change it to a desired port if you choose to do so e.g. app.listen(<port>,()=>{
    console.log('listening on <port>)
})
3. In the terminal, type the command 'node listen.js' - a log in your console should indicate that the your port is listening for requests e.g listening on port 9090
4. In your web API testing software you can make a call to the below endpoints

GET - localhost:9090/api
lists all available endpoints in response

GET - localhost:9090/api/topics

GET - localhost:9090/api/articles

 **Test Environment**

# Testing endpoints using the test suite and test database #

1. As mentioned above, running the testing suite with the command 'npm run test __tests__/app.test.js' will perform all tests on the endpoints in the file app.js
2. These tests are only performed on the test database and re-seeded each time you run the command
3. All new tests should be written in the file app.test.js
